# [buffer-trainer](https://elliottkobelansky.github.io/buffer-trainer/)
Train floating buffers for 3BLD.

## Purpose
Gives scrambles with no parity, no cycle breaks, and no flips/twists.

Designed with the intention to ease learning the floating 3-cycles of later buffers. These 3-cycles are the "tools" needed to solve with full floating. This trainer is not designed for the application of the tools, just for the acquisition of them.


## Usage

Pretty self evident. Buffer order can be switched by dragging the boxes on the left/right edges of the screen.
